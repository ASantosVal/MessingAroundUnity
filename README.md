# MessingAroundUnity
Just that, some messing around using unity. Started following [Brackeys' tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL), now it's just a place to test PoCs.
## How do I play this
Builds can be found under `Builds/Windows/`. Just download the whole folder and run MessingAroundUnity.exe. If you trust me, of course. And don't expect a lot from this.
